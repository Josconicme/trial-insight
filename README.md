Of course. A great `README.md` file is essential for any project, especially for a hackathon submission. It's the first thing judges and other developers will see.

Here is a complete, professional, and detailed `README.md` file tailored specifically for your **TrialInsight** project.

**Instructions:**
1.  In the root directory of your `trial-insight` project, create a new file named `README.md`.
2.  Copy the entire content below and paste it into that new file.
3.  **Important:** You will need to fill in two placeholder links near the top: the link to your live deployed application and the link to your demo video.

# üî¨ TrialInsight: AI-Powered Clinical Trial Intelligence

**TrialInsight** is a modern, AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients interact with the vast and complex world of clinical trials. By leveraging the power of Google Cloud's Generative AI and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, TrialInsight transforms raw trial data into actionable, searchable, and understandable intelligence.

This project was built for the **Google Cloud Hackathon: AI in Action**.

## üéØ The Problem

The official `ClinicalTrials.gov` database is an incredible resource, but it contains hundreds of thousands of entries with dense, technical language. Finding relevant trials can be a slow, keyword-based process that often misses conceptually similar studies. Researchers waste valuable time sifting through data, and patients may struggle to find trials they are eligible for.

## ‚ú® The Solution

TrialInsight solves this problem by providing a multi-layered AI approach:

1.  **Natural Language Search:** Users can search the database using plain English queries (e.g., "completed phase 2 trials for pediatric leukemia"), and our AI backend parses this query to find the most relevant results.
2.  **AI-Generated Summaries:** For every trial, our platform uses Google's `text-bison` Large Language Model to generate a concise, professional summary, making it easy to grasp the trial's purpose at a glance.
3.  **Semantic Similarity Search:** This is our standout feature. Using Google's embedding models and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, TrialInsight can find other trials that are *semantically* and *conceptually* related, even if they don't share the exact same keywords. This helps researchers uncover novel connections and discover related studies they might have otherwise missed.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Intelligent Search:** Full-text and natural language search capabilities.
*   **AI-Powered Summaries:** On-demand, concise summaries for every clinical trial.
*   **Vector-Based Similarity:** Discover related trials based on conceptual meaning, not just keywords.
*   **Modern, Responsive UI:** A clean, dark-themed, and easy-to-navigate user interface built with React.
*   **Serverless AI Pipeline:** An event-driven architecture using MongoDB Atlas Triggers to automatically enrich data with AI-generated content in the background.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project utilizes a modern, scalable, and cloud-native tech stack, with a clear separation between the frontend, backend, and data processing layers.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** For building a fast, component-based user interface.
    *   **React Router:** For multi-page navigation.
    *   **CSS:** For clean, modern styling.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Node.js & Express.js:** For creating a fast and reliable REST API.
    *   **MongoDB Atlas:** The core database for storing and querying trial data.
    *   **Mongoose:** As the ODM for interacting with MongoDB.

*   **AI & Cloud Services:**
    *   **Google Cloud Vertex AI:**
        *   `text-embedding-004` model for generating vector embeddings.
        *   `text-bison@002` model for generating AI summaries.
    *   **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search:** For indexing embeddings and performing high-speed semantic similarity searches.
    *   **MongoDB Atlas Triggers:** For creating a serverless, event-driven pipeline that automatically calls Google's AI APIs to enrich new data as it's inserted into the database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project Locally

To run TrialInsight on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
*   A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account (M0 Free Tier is sufficient).
*   A [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account with billing enabled.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trial-insight.git
cd trial-insight
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

*   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
*   Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
*   Fill in the required values:
    *   `MONGODB_URI`: Your standard connection string from MongoDB Atlas.
    *   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`: Your unique GCP project ID.
    *   `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: An API Key from GCP with the "Geocoding API" enabled.
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: *(If you switched to OpenAI, add this here)*.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary packages for the project from the root directory.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure MongoDB Atlas

*   **Atlas Trigger:** Follow the setup guide to create the `processNewTrial` database trigger. This trigger is responsible for calling the Google AI APIs to generate embeddings and summaries for new data.
*   **Vector Search Index:** In the Atlas UI, create a Vector Search index named `vector_search_index` on the `trials` collection. The index should be configured for the `embedding` field with 768 dimensions (for Google's model) or 1536 dimensions (for OpenAI's model) and `cosine` similarity.

### 5. Run the Data & AI Pipeline

This command will populate your database with data from `ClinicalTrials.gov`. The Atlas Trigger will then automatically process this data in the background.

```bash
npm run run-pipeline
```
*(Wait a few minutes for the Atlas Trigger to finish processing the data. You can monitor its progress in the Atlas App Services logs.)*

### 6. Start the Servers

You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals from the project root.

**Terminal 1: Start Backend**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Your application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
